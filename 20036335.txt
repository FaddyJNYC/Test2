The distinction between imaging and computational neuroscience has
become increasingly blurred over the past decade. The statistical and
computational expertise required to design and analyse neuroimaging
experiments means that most practitioners in functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (i.e.,
electroencephalography, EEG and magnetoencephalography, MEG) could
call themselves computational neuroscientists, at least in a pragmatic
sense. Computational neuroscience subsumes several disciplines and
techniques; we highlight two domains that have particular relevance
for neuroimaging; namely, models of brain function (that try to
account for perception, action and cognition) and biophysical models
of neuronal dynamics. Both have had an enormous influence on imaging
neuroscience and have enabled us to ask fairly deep questions of our
data. Over the past decade, one could argue that the constructs of
cognitive science have been replaced incrementally with schemes from
computational neuroscience, machine learning and optimal decision or
game theory. Not only do these schemes provide a mechanistic
formulation but, in many cases, allow one to make quantitative
predictions that can be operationalised in terms of explanatory
variables (e.g., regressors in an fMRI design matrix). The implicit
recession of traditional cognitive theories is evidenced on many
fronts: for example, a preoccupation with autonomous brain dynamics as
measured with resting state fMRI (e.g., Raichle et al., 2001; Morcom
and Fletcher, 2007; Achard et al., 2006; Honey et al., 2007; Greicius
et al., 2009; Deco et al., 2009) or electrophysiology (e.g., Del Cul
et al., 2007; Hesselmann et al., 2008; Tognoli and Kelso 2009); a
growing preponderance of studies in neuroeconomics and game theory
(e.g., O'Doherty et al., 2003; Rodriguez et al., 2006; Delgado et al.,
2008; Rangel et al., 2008; Krajbich et al., 2009). Other examples and
appeal to optimal control (e.g., Grafton et al., 2008; Behrens et al.,
2007) and information theory (e.g., Strange et al., 2005) to ask how
the brain makes optimal decisions under uncertainty. Within
perception, there is growing interest in the role of top-down and
bottom-up effects (e.g., Murray et al., 2002; Garrido et al.,
2007a,b), which are understood increasingly in terms of message-
passing and Bayesian inference (e.g., Gregory, 1980; Ballard et al.,
1983; Mumford, 1992; Dayan et al., 1995; Ma et al., 2008). At their
heart, all these approaches rest on ideas that transcend conventional
psychology.A similar theme is echoed in the modelling of neuronal
dynamics, where there is a growing move away from simple descriptive
models and towards biophysically informed forward models of data.
Pertinent examples include advances in electrophysiological source
modelling (e.g., Lopes da Silva et al., 1974; Jansen and Rit, 1995;
Robinson et al., 1997; Jirsa and Kelso, 2000; Nummenmaa et al., 2007;
Mattout et al., 2006; Clearwater et al., 2008; Wipf and Nagarajan,
2009; Alstott et al., 2009). These advances allow the informed
interrogation of evoked and induced responses at their sources
(cerebral cortex), as opposed to sensors (channel space). In terms of
biophysics, a progressive refinement of observation models has taken
us from simple linear convolution models for fMRI to state-space
models with hidden neuronal and hemodynamic states that can explain
multiple modalities (e.g., Daunizeau et al., 2007; Valdes-Sosa et al.,
2009). These are examples of David et al., 2004, 2006). This is
important because it means that DCM can now call on computational
neuroscience to furnish models of neuronal activity, in terms of
ensemble dynamics and neural-mass models (e.g., van Albada et al.,
2009; Deco et al., 2009; see Deco et al., 2008, for review). This
represents a practical and useful coupling of empirical neuroimaging
with computational theory, which we will pursue later.Model comparison
and implicit hypothesis testing is seen even in apparently descriptive
studies. For example, some of the most exciting insights to emerge
from the study of resting state networks in fMRI (Achard et al., 2006;
Bassett et al., 2006; Honey et al. 2009; Greicius et al., 2009) rest
on their formal similarities to simulated dynamics on small-world or
scale-free connectivity structures (Honey et al., 2007; Deco et al.,
2009). The point here is that the emergent behaviour of generative
models with Kriener et al., 2008; Müller-Linow et al., 2008; Rubinov
et al., 2009) enables the behaviour of different models to be compared
against observed behaviour. In other words, the spectral properties
and spatial deployment of self-organised dynamics in the brain place
constraints on the anatomical and functional architectures that could
support them. This macroscopic organisation is related to self-
organised pattern formation in neural fields (Jirsa and Haken, 1996;
Coombes and Doole, 1996; Freeman, 2005; Buice and Cowan, 2009) of the
sort described by Coombes (2010). In short, biophysical models play an
important role as generative models; both in the context of studying
emergent behaviours and as dynamic causal models for data. In what
follows, we will try to highlight the implicit role of generative
models in the applications considered.This review comprises two
sections. In the first, we consider generative models of brain
function that are cast in purely functionalist terms. We start with a
brief overview of recent trends in modelling designed fMRI experiments
and illustrate the basic approach using a recent example from our own
laboratory. This example addresses theory of mind in cooperative games
and shows how computational techniques can contribute to issues in
social neuroscience (see also King-Casas et al., 2008). In the second
section, we turn to biophysical modelling of distributed neuronal
responses, where the key questions concern the underlying functional
architectures generating brain signals. We will focus on dynamic
causal modelling and overview recent advances in modelling
electrophysiological data. We conclude with a brief survey of future
developments and reiterate the importance of computational
neuroscience and dynamical systems theory in neuroimaging.In this
section, we sketch the use of computational models of brain function
in the modelling of fMRI data and provide an example that illustrates
a number of key points. In the past five or so years, a new sort of
data modelling philosophy has emerged: Instead of simply modelling
observed brain signals in terms of experimental factors (e.g., as in
conventional ANOVA models), researchers have begun to explain their
data in terms of quantities the brain must encode, under simplifying
assumptions about how the brain works (O'Doherty et al., 2003; Haruno
and Kawato, 2006; O'Doherty et al., 2007; Rangel et al., 2008). These
assumptions usually rest on the notion that the brain is trying to
optimise something. In perception, this can be cast in terms of
maximising the mutual information between sensory inputs and internal
representations of their causes (Barlow, 1961; Linsker, 1990; Atick
and Redlich, 1992; Olshausen and Field, 1996) or, equivalently, the
minimization of prediction error (Mumford, 1992; Rao and Ballard,
1998; Murray et al., 2002). In terms of motor control, many cost
functions have been proposed, which the brain tries to minimize during
action (Todorov and Jordan, 1998; Kording and Wolpert, 2004; Shadmehr
and Krakauer, 2008). Again, these can usually be reduced to some form
of prediction error (e.g., Tseng et al., 2007; Grafton et al., 2008).
Optimal decision theory (i.e., game theory) and reinforcement learning
assume that choices and behaviour are trying to maximize expected
utility or reward, where this optimisation rests upon learning the
value or quality of sensory contingencies and action (Bellman, 1952;
Rescorla and Wagner, 1972; Watkins and Dayan, 1992; Camerer, 2003;
Todorov, 2006). Interestingly, this learning may rest on minimization
of a (reward) prediction error (Sutton and Barto, 1981; Montague et
al., 1995; Schultz, 1998; Daw and Doya, 2006). In short, most
computational formulations of brain function can be cast as an
optimization of some function of sensory input, with respect to
internal brain states and the actions it emits. Indeed, our own
theoretical work suggests that all these quantities are the same
thing, namely free energy (Friston, Kilner and Harrison, 2006), which,
under some simplifying assumptions, is prediction error.The central
theme of Barlow, 1961), the infomax principle (Linsker, 1990; Atick
and Redlich, 1992; Olshausen and Field, 1996), predictive coding (Rao
and Ballard, 1998), the Bayesian brain hypothesis and so on (see
Friston, 2010, for a formal account of how these principles can be
unified). For action and optimal decision theory the same assumption
manifests as Bayes optimality and bounded rationality (where bounds
place constraints on optimisation). This rests on an assumption that
subjects extremise an expected utility or cost function, which links
perceptual (Bayesian) inference on hidden states of the world to
behaviour and choice. The (bounded) optimality assumption is extremely
useful, because it provides a principled way to specify the mapping
between sensory inputs and observed behaviour. Furthermore, it
suggests candidate (latent) variables that may mediate this mapping
and be represented by brain states. This means one can work out what
an ideal Bayesian observer or rational person would do in response to
cues, under a particular model of cue generation and cue outcome
associations. The model can then be optimised in relation to observed
behaviour and its latent variables used as explanatory variables to
identify their (regionally specific) neurophysiological
correlates.Practically, this sort of analysis calls for a paradigm
that invokes inference (or learning) and decisions (or responses). The
latent variables (e.g., surprise, prediction error, value,
uncertainly, etc.) entailed by the paradigm are then evaluated under
optimality assumptions (e.g., the subject is Bayes optimal).
Sometimes, the stimuli or paradigm may specify these variables
directly (e.g., in studies of novelty such as Strange et al., 2005).
More often, the subject's behaviour is used to resolve uncertainty
about which model or model parameters a particular subject is actually
using. In these cases, the optimal responses are matched (in a maximum
likelihood sense) to the subjects' choices by adjusting the parameters
of a Bayes optimal scheme. Once a match is attained, the implicit
latent variables subtending Bayes optimal responses are used to
explain observed brain responses. In other words, they are convolved
with a hemodynamic response function to form regressors in
conventional linear convolution models of fMRI signals. Significant
areas in the ensuing statistical parametric map (or Perhaps the best
example of this approach is the use of reward prediction error to
build regressors for fMRI. Reward prediction error is a key latent
variable in reinforcement learning and related models of optimal
control. These include classical psychological models (Rescorla and
Wagner, 1972), temporal difference models (a standard model-free
scheme for value learning; Sutton and Barto, 1981) and Q-learning
(Watkins and Dayan, 1992). The reward prediction error reports the
difference in the expected reward (i.e., value) and observed reward.
When reward prediction error has been minimised, value learning is
complete and the value function (encoding predicted reward) specifies
an optimal behavioural policy. There is now a large literature on the
neurophysiological correlates of reward prediction error and the
functional anatomy of value learning; with a particular focus on the
ventral striatum and related structures (e.g., O'Doherty et al., 2003;
O'Doherty, 2004; Daw et al., 2006; Haruno and Kawato, 2006; O'Doherty
et al., 2007; Rangel et al., 2008, Wittmann et al., 2008). As a result
of these computational fMRI studies, ventral striatal responses can
now be treated as a proxy for unexpected rewards of the sort predicted
by temporal difference models. This is remarkable, because until
recently the only regionally specific correlates of reward came from
invasive unit electrode recordings (Schultz, 1998). Examples of
computational fMRI outside the domain of reward include motor control,
where optimality theories can be evaluated against empirical fMRI data
(Grafton et al., 2008), and the use of constructs from information
theory to quantify novelty and surprise, to index how the brain
encodes causal regularities (or volatility) in our sensorium (e.g.,
Strange et al., 2005; Behrens et al., 2007). Finally, formal economic
models are also informing neuroimaging in neuroeconomics and social
neurosciences in a compelling way (e.g., Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005;
Delgado et al., 2008; Krajbich et al., 2009).An important aspect of
computational fMRI is that one can test different computational models
against each other using fMRI responses themselves. This means it may
be possible to go beyond the neural correlates of presumed mental
(computational) processes and actually adjudicate among different
computational schemes on the basis of their neurophysiological
implementation. Furthermore, the precise mapping from computational
variables to neuronal representations can be established by optimising
neurometric functions, which map from computational variables to
observed neuronal responses. In what follows we provide a brief
example, which illustrates how latent variables or mental states can
be accessed and then how they can be used to explain neuronal
activity.Consider how we represent the intentions of others in
cooperative games or social interactions (e.g., Gallagher et al.,
2002; Frith and Frith, 2003; Maynard Smith, 1982; Camerer et al.,
2004; Hampton et al., 2008). To establish the underlying functional
anatomy, we need to quantify the key variables that map from sensory
cues to optimal responses. These variables are entailed by formal
models of optimal decision theory based on value or expected utility.
Yoshida et al. (2008) described one such model, for two or more
players in cooperative games, which invokes a value function over the
joint state space of all players. However, this creates a difficult
problem for the brain because the representation and optimisation of a
joint value–function induces an infinite regression. This is because
to evaluate your state and mine, I need to know how you value my
state, which means I need to know how you value my evaluation and so
on Fig. 1). This inference was quantified in terms of a probability
distribution over different levels of sophistication and summarised in
terms of its mode (most probable) and entropy (or uncertainty). These
two latent variables were then convolved with a hemodynamic response
function and used as regressors in a conventional SPM analysis. Fig. 2
summarises the results of this analysis and shows a double
dissociation between lateral and medial prefrontal cortex that encoded
the opponent's sophistication and associated uncertainty,
respectively.This example highlights a number of paradigmatic aspects
of computational fMRI. First, it enforces a principled model of
probabilistic computations that underlie inference and choice. Second,
it shows how the unknown parameters of a model can be optimised in
relation to observed behaviour to access latent variables that mediate
performance; here, a probabilistic representation of the opponent's
sophistication. This was the key variable that subjects had to infer
to play the game in an optimal fashion. Third it highlights a subtle,
but fundamental, issue in computational fMRI; we have to infer the
subject's inference. This is a special problem in neuroscience, where
the system we make inferences about (i.e., the brain) is itself making
inferences. Finally, it shows how one can test different functions of
latent variables as candidates for representation in the brain; here,
the mode and entropy of sophistication. There are many examples of
this sort in the literature that highlight the utility of
computational models as generative models of both behaviour and
underlying brain states. In one sense, one could regard these models
as facilitating a fusion of behavioural and neurophysiological
responses; because both are explained by the same generative
(computational) model. This should be contrasted with the conventional
approach of simply modelling behaviours or stimuli per se, without
reference to the latent variables that are entailed computationally
and have to be represented by the brain.We conclude this section with
some current examples of computational fMRI and how it is being used
to test computational hypotheses. So far, we have considered models
based upon how subjects make decisions that maximise reward. In some
situations subjects have to deal with uncertainty in relation to
outcomes of their choices, which leads to a trade-off between
exploitation of a known option and exploring unknown options to
maximise long-term reward. This class of problem is known as the
explore–exploit dilemma. One suggestion is that the value of
exploration involves an uncertainty bonus and that this enhanced
uncertainty valuation involves dopamine (Kakade and Dayan, 2002).
However, a computational fMRI study testing these ideas showed that
there was no evidence for an uncertainty bonus, at either the level of
behaviour or neuronally (Daw et al., 2006). A related idea is that
exploration of the environment is mediated by ascribing bonuses to
novelty rather than uncertainty (Kakade and Dayan, 2002). Wittmann et
al. (2008) tested these ideas using a multiarmed bandit task, which
included familiar and unfamiliar (novel) choice options. Using a
Q-learning model, the authors showed that there was an optimistic
initialisation of the value of novel relative to familiar choices.
This optimistic initialisation was associated with an enhanced signal
in the striatum for novel choices. In this case there was both
behavioural and neuronal evidence that was consistent with the
theoretical predictions. This is a nice example of how computational
fMRI can adjudicate among competing computations models and lend them
an empirical validity. Although model (i.e., hypothesis) comparison is
only just emerging as a generic tool in imaging neuroscience, most of
the statistical machinery is already in place. For example, it is now
possible to produce maps of the evidence for one model, relative to
another, at each point in the brain (Rosa et al., 2010). These
Bayesian model selection (BMS) maps are a special case of posterior
probability maps (PPMs), where the probability pertains not to a
parameter or treatment effect under a particular model, but the model
itself, in relation to other models.Our focus in this section has been
on associating brain areas with computational processes. However, this
association itself can engender important new questions about the
mapping between computational and physiological processes. For
example, reward prediction error typically maps onto regions that are
either the source (D'Ardenne et al., 2008) or target (e.g., O'Doherty
et al., 2003; O'Doherty, 2004; Daw et al., 2006) of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons. This begs the question about how and where the
unique impact of dopaminergic input is expressed post-synaptically.
Indeed, the interpretation of neuroimaging signals, in relation to
dopaminergic discharges, has become a key focus recently (Düzel et
al., 2009).In summary, an increasing number of studies now use fMRI to
adjudicate among models of neuronal computations and their functional
architectures. These studies rest on replacing traditional explanatory
variables in statistical models of imaging data with quantities
generated by computational models that are actually doing something.
The most developed examples are models of reinforcement and value
learning (O'Doherty et al., 2003; Rodriguez et al., 2006; Haruno and
Kawato, 2006; O'Doherty et al., 2007). They involve (i) formulating a
computational model that represents a hypothesis about how the brain
optimises its responses, (ii) optimising the model in relation to
overt behavioural data and (iii) using the model's latent variables to
predict regionally specific fMRI responses. These studies make
computational neuroscience accountable to empirical neurophysiology
and have established computational neuroimaging as an exciting new
paradigm. In the next section, we leave computational or functional
models of what the brain might represent and turn to biophysical
models of representations per se.In this section, we address
computational approaches to modelling neuronal dynamics. Biophysical
models of neuronal dynamics are usually used for one of two things:
either to understand the emergent properties of neuronal systems or as
observation models for measured neuronal responses. We discuss
examples of both. In terms of emergent behaviours, we will consider
Kriener et al., 2008; Rubinov et al., 2009; Buice and Cowan, 2009) and
how this has been applied to characterising autonomous or endogenous
fluctuations in fMRI signals (e.g., Honey et al., 2007; Deco et al.,
2009). We then consider neuronal models that are used to explain
responses elicited in designed experiments.There has been a recent
upsurge in studies of fMRI signal correlations observed while the
brain is at rest (Biswal et al., 1995). These patterns seem to reflect
anatomical connectivity (Greicius et al., 2009) and can be
characterized in terms of remarkably reproducible principal components
or modes (i.e., resting state networks). One of these modes
recapitulates the pattern of deactivations observed across a range of
activation studies (the default mode; Raichle et al., 2001). These
studies highlight that, even at rest, endogenous brain activity is
self-organizing and highly structured. In this context, there are many
mechanistic questions about the genesis of autonomous dynamics and the
structures that support them. Some of the most interesting work in
this field has come from computational anatomy and neuroscience. The
emerging picture is that endogenous fluctuations are a consequence of
dynamics on anatomical connectivity structures with particular scale-
invariant and small-world characteristics (Achard et al., 2006; Honey
et al., 2007; Bassett et al., 2006; Deco et al., 2009). These are
well-studied and universal characteristics of complex systems and
suggest that we may be able to understand the brain in terms of
universal phenomena. For example, Buice and Cowan (2009) model
neocortical dynamics using field theoretic methods for nonequilibrium
statistical processes to describe both neural fluctuations and
responses to stimuli. They predict that at low spiking rates,
neocortical activity will exhibit a phase transition, which is in the
universality class of directed percolation. In their models, the
density and spatial extent of lateral cortical interactions induce a
region of state-space, in which the effects of fluctuations are
negligible. However, as the generation and decay of neuronal activity
becomes more balanced, there is a crossover into a critical
fluctuation region. This approach suggests that the scaling laws found
in many measurements of neocortical activity are consistent with the
existence of phase transitions at a critical point. It shows how such
properties lead to both random and rhythmic brain activity (Buice and
Cowan, 2009) and speaks to larger questions about how the brain
maintains its dynamics near phase-transitions (i.e., self-organised
criticality; Kitzbichler et al., 2009) and the putative role of
cortical gain control (Abbott et al., 1997). This is an important
issue, because self-organization near phase transitions shows
universal patterns and structures, as studied in synergetics (e.g.,
Jirsa et al., 1994; Tschacher and Haken, 2007). Synergetics rests on
the order-parameter concept, which was generalised by Haken to the
enslaving principle, i.e., the dynamics of fast-relaxing (stable)
modes are completely determined by the slow dynamics of order-
parameters (the amplitudes of a small number of unstable modes).
Understanding and characterising these modes may be an important step
towards a universal dynamical model of how the brain organises itself
to predict and act on its sensorium.Although there have been recent
papers arguing for criticality and power law effects in large-scale
cortical activity (e.g. Kitzbichler et al., 2009; Linkenkaer-Hansen et
al., 2001; Stam and de Bruin, 2004; Freyer et al., 2009) there is also
work that argues otherwise; at least at higher frequencies (e.g.
Bedard et al., 2006, Miller et al., 2007, Touboul and Destexhe, 2009).
The important distinction appears to be that ‘slow’ frequencies
(< 30 Hz) may contain critical oscillations, whereas high frequency
coherent oscillations (including gamma) may reflect other dynamical
processes. In short, endogenous fluctuations may be one way in which
anatomy speaks to us through dynamics. They also suggest important
questions about how fluctuations shape evoked responses (e.g.,
Hesselmann et al., 2008).Computational approaches to understanding
phenomena in neuroimaging data focus on emergent dynamics and the
constraints under which brain-like behaviour manifest. In the
remainder of this section, we turn to computational models that try to
explain observed neuronal activity directly. This is a relatively new
field that rests on recent advances in model fitting or inversion.
Model inversion is important: to date, most efforts in computational
neuroscience have focused on generative models of neuronal dynamics
(that define a mapping from causes to neuronal dynamics). The
inversion of these models (the mapping from neuronal dynamics to their
causes) now allows one to test different models against empirical
data. This is best exemplified by dynamic causal modelling.Dynamic
causal modelling refers to Bayesian inversion and comparison of
dynamic models that cause observed data. These models are usually
formulated in continuous time and can be regarded as state-space
models. Usually, but not necessarily, these formulations are in terms
of ordinary differential equations that govern the motion of hidden
neurophysiological states, while an observer function maps from hidden
states to observed brain signals. This mapping is probabilistic and
involves some observation noise. Noise at the level of the hidden
states would call upon stochastic differential equations (i.e.,
stochastic DCMs; Friston et al., 2008) but these have been used less,
so far.Differential equations are essential when modelling the
dynamics of biological processes and accommodate computational
neuroscience models gracefully. The basic idea behind DCM is to
formulate one or more models of how data are caused in terms of a
network of distributed sources. These sources talk to each other
through parameterised connections and influence the dynamics of hidden
states that are intrinsic to each source. Model inversion provides
conditional densities on their parameters; namely extrinsic connection
strengths and intrinsic (synaptic) parameters. These conditional
densities can be used to integrate out dependencies on the parameters
to provide the probability of the data given the model per se (see
Friston et al., 2007, for a technical review) This is known as the DCM
was originally introduced for fMRI using a simple state-space model
based upon a bilinear approximation to the underlying equations of
motion that couple neuronal states in different brain regions (Friston
et al., 2003). This approximation is parameterised in terms of
coupling parameters that correspond to Most DCMs consider point
sources both for fMRI and EEG data (cf. equivalent current dipoles)
and are formally equivalent to Penny et al., 2004). Recently, the
power of Bayesian model comparison, in the context of dynamic causal
modelling, has become increasing evident. This now represents one of
the most important applications of DCM and allows different hypotheses
to be tested, where each DCM corresponds to a specific hypothesis
about functional brain architectures (e.g., Acs and Greenlee, 2008;
Allen et al., 2008; Grol et al., 2007; Heim et al., 2009; Smith et
al., 2006; Stephan et al., 2007; Summerfield and Koechlin,
2008).Although DCM is probably best known through its application to
fMRI, most recent advances have focused on neurobiologically plausible
models of electrophysiological dynamics, which grounds them in
computational neuroscience. Furthermore, different data features
(e.g., ERPs or induced responses) can be modelled with the same DCM
and it has even been applied to steady state recordings, under local
stationarity assumptions. Figs. 3–7 illustrate some key developments
in DCM, which we now review briefly.The biological plausibility of
DCMs for fMRI has been increased by modelling excitatory and
inhibitory sub-populations within each source of fMRI signal
(Marreiros et al., 2008). This enables one to model excitatory and
inhibitory connections, through positivity constraints (i.e.,
enforcing a connection to be positive or negative). The beauty of
these models is that one can use them to test hypotheses about
selective changes in intrinsic and extrinsic connectivity that
meditate fMRI responses. See Fig. 3 for an example, which uses model
comparison to identify the locus of attentional modulation. The second
development has been to refine the mapping between neuronal activity
and hemodynamic signals (using model comparison) to adjudicate among
models that have emerged in the physiological and MRI physics
literature (Obata et al., 2004; Stephan et al., 2007). Finally, the
original bilinear form of DCM has been extended to a nonlinear
formulation, with addition of a term that incorporates the modulation
of coupling between two regions by a third (Stephan et al., 2008).
This can be important, when considering things like the origin of top-
down effects (e.g., attention).More recent efforts have focused on
DCMs for electromagnetic (EEG and MEG) data (David et al., 2006;
Kiebel et al., 2006, 2007; Garrido et al., 2007a,b, 2008; Chen et al.,
2008), with related developments to cover local field potential (LFP)
recordings (Moran et al., 2007, 2008). These models are more
sophisticated than the neuronal models for fMRI and are based upon
neural-mass or mean-field models of interacting neuronal populations.
Typically each source of electromagnetic activity is modelled as an
equivalent current dipole (or ensemble of small cortical patches);
whose activity reflects the depolarisation of three populations
(usually one inhibitory and two excitatory). Crucially, one can embed
any neural-mass model into DCM. These can include models based upon
second-order linear differential equations (cf. Lopes da Silva et al.,
1974; Jansen and Rit, 1995) or conductance-based models based on
nonlinear differential equations (cf. Morris and Lecar, 1981).The
variant used most commonly is based on the form suggested by Jansen
and Rit (1995). These models comprise (i) simple linear second-order
differential equations describing depolarisation and (ii) a static
nonlinearity mapping from depolarisation to spiking. Spiking couples
the activity of one population to another. As with DCM for fMRI, DCMs
for EEG and MEG are just generalisations of conventional (equivalent
current dipole) models that have been finessed by parameterised
connections among and within sources (David et al., 2006). These
models fall into the class of spatiotemporal dipole models (Scherg and
Von Cramon, 1985) and enable the entire time series over peristimulus
time to constrain the estimates of their parameters and evidence. Face
validation of these models has used known electrophysiological
phenomena and established metrics of coupling (e.g., David and
Friston, 2003; David et al., 2004). Their predictive validity has been
established in a series of experiments using the mismatch negativity
(Näätänen, 2003) as an exemplar sensory learning paradigm (e.g.,
Garrido et al., 2007a, 2008).Developments in this area have been rapid
and can be summarised along two lines. First, researchers have
explored more realistic neural-mass models based upon nonlinear
differential equations whose states correspond to voltages and
conductances (cf. Morris and Lecar, 1981; see Fig. 4). This allows one
to formulate DCMs in terms of well-characterised (if simple) synaptic
dynamics and model different types of receptor-mediated currents
explicitly. Furthermore, conventional neural-mass modelling (which
considers only the average state of a neuronal ensemble) has been
extended to cover ensemble dynamics in terms of population densities.
This involves modelling not just the average but also the dispersion
and covariance among the states of different populations (Harrison et
al., 2005; Marreiros et al., 2009). See Fig. 5 for an example of the
effect that modelling the dispersion of neuronal states can have on
population responses.The second line of development pertains to the
particular data features the models try to explain. In conventional
DCMs for ERPs, the time course of voltage at the sensors is modelled
explicitly. However, DCMs for spectral responses (Moran et al., 2007;
Moran et al., 2008) can be applied to continuous recordings of
arbitrary length. This modelling initiative rests on a linear systems
analysis of the underlying neural-mass model to give a predicted
spectral response for unknown but parameterised endogenous input. This
means that, given the spectral profile of electrophysiological
recordings, one can estimate the coupling among different sources and
the spectral energy of neuronal and observation noise generating
observed spectra. This has proved particularly useful for LFP
recordings and has been validated using animal models and
psychopharmacological constructs (Moran et al., 2007, 2008). Indeed,
this could be a potentially important tool in studies of receptor
function and related learning paradigms in animals and man. Finally,
there are DCMs for induced responses (Chen et al., 2008). Like the
steady state models, these predict the spectral density of responses
but in a time-dependent fashion. The underlying neural model here is
based upon the simple bilinear approximation to any neuronal dynamics.
The key benefit of these DCMs is that one can quantify the evidence
for between-frequency coupling among sources, relative to homologous
models restricted to within-frequency coupling. Coupling between
frequencies corresponds to nonlinear coupling. Being able to detect
nonlinear coupling is important because it speaks to the synaptic
mechanisms that might differentiate between forward and backward
connections in the brain.To provide a concrete example of how DCM has
been used to build a picture of dynamic computation in the brain, we
focus on the role of forward and backward message-passing among
hierarchically deployed cortical areas (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991).
This example draws from the functional models of the previous section:
recall that current formulations of perceptual inference and learning
can be cast in terms of minimising prediction error (e.g., predictive
coding; Mumford, 1992; Rao and Ballard, 1998; Murray et al., 2002; Lee
and Mumford, 2003) or, more generally, Friston et al., 2006). The
predictive coding and free-energy models suggest that prediction
errors are passed forward from lower levels of sensory hierarchies to
higher levels, to optimise representations in the brain's generative
model of the sensorium. Predictions based upon these representations
are then passed down backward connections to suppress or explain away
prediction errors. The message-passing scheme that emerges rests upon
reciprocal or recurrent self-organised dynamics that necessarily
involve forward and backward connections. There are some key
predictions that arise from this scheme. First, top-down influences
mediated by backward connections should have a tangible influence on
evoked responses that are modulated by prior expectations induced by
priming and attention. Second, the excitatory influences of forward
(glutamatergic) connections must be balanced by the (polysynaptic)
inhibitory influence of backward connections; this completes the
feedback loop suppressing prediction error. Third, the backward
connections should involve nonlinear or modulatory effects; because it
is these, and only these, that model nonlinearities in the world that
generate sensory input.These functionally grounded attributes of
forward and backward connections and their asymmetries are exactly the
sort of issue that biophysical models are used to test. A fairly
comprehensive picture is now emerging from DCM studies using several
modalities and paradigms: Initial studies focused on attentional
modulation in visual processing. These studies confirmed that the
attentional modulation of visually evoked responses throughout the
visual hierarchy could be accounted for by changes in the strength of
connections mediated by attentional set (see Friston, Harrison and
Penny, 2003; Fig. 3). In other words, no extra input was required to
explain attention-related responses; these were explained sufficiently
by recurrent dynamics among reciprocally connected areas whose
influence on each other increased during attentive states.More
recently the temporal anatomy of forward and backward influences has
been addressed using DCM for event related potentials ERPs. Garrido et
al. (2007b) used Bayesian model comparison to show that the evidence
for backward connections was more pronounced in later components of
the ERP. Put in another way, backward connections are necessary to
explain late or endogenous response components in simple auditory ERPs
(see Fig. 6). These results fit comfortably with the dynamics of
reciprocally connected neuronal populations, whose time constants are
much greater than any single neuronal unit within each population.
Garrido et al., (2008) then went on to ask whether one could
understand repetition suppression in terms of changes in forward and
backward connection strengths that are entailed by predictive coding.
DCM showed that repetition suppression, of the sort that might explain
the mismatch negativity (Näätänen, 2003), could be explained purely in
terms of a change in forward and backward connections with repeated
exposure to a particular stimulus. Furthermore, by using functional
forms for the repetition-dependent changes in coupling strength,
Garrido et al. (2009) showed that changes in extrinsic (cortico-
cortical) coupling were formally distinct from intrinsic (within area)
coupling. This was consistent with theoretical predictions about
changes in post-synaptic gain with surprise and distinct changes in
synaptic efficacy associated with learning under predictive coding.
Finally, Chen et al. (2009) addressed functional asymmetries in
forward and backward connections during face perception, using DCM for
induced responses. These asymmetries were expressed in terms of
nonlinear or cross-frequency coupling; where high frequencies in a
lower area excited low frequencies in a higher area, whereas the
reciprocal influences where inhibitory (see Fig. 7). These results may
be related to the differential expression of gamma activity in
superficial and deep pyramidal cells that are the origin of forward
and backward connections, respectively (see Chrobak and Buzsaki, 1998;
Roopun et al., 2008; Fries, 2009).In conclusion, we have come some
way, in terms of understanding the functional anatomy of forward and
backward connections in the brain. Interestingly, some of the more
compelling insights have been obtained by using biophysical models
with simple paradigms (like the mismatch negativity) and simple
noninvasive techniques (like EEG). Despite the simplicity of these
empirical techniques, computational neuroscience equips us with models
or ‘mathematical microscopes’ that see beyond the surface structure of
data.In summary, dynamic causal modelling calls on biophysical models
of neuronal dynamics by treating them as generative models for
empirical time series. The ensuing inferences pertain to the models
per se and their parameters (e.g., effective connectivity) that
generate observed responses. Using model comparison, one can search
over wide model spaces to find optimal architectures or networks.
Having selected the best model (or subset of models), one then has
access to the posterior density on the neuronal and coupling
parameters defining the network. Of key interest here are changes in
coupling that are induced experimentally with, for example, drugs,
attentional set or time. These experimentally induced changes enable
one to characterise the context-sensitive reconfiguration of brain
networks and test hypotheses about the relative influence of top-down
and bottom-up signals. We now conclude with a few comments on future
developments in computational neuroimaging.Computational neuroimaging
has been reviewed here in terms of functionally informed computational
models of brain function and biophysically informed computational
models of neuronal processes. We have also made passing reference to
dynamical systems theory when explaining self-organised dynamics that
play out on anatomical brain structures. One might ask, where all this
is going? One obvious answer is the integration of these streams; an
integration that presents interesting and important challenges. First,
can we use computational models of brain function to constrain
biophysical models of observed brain responses? Although there have
been heuristic interpretations of dynamic causal models, that rest on
computational theories of brain function, no one has yet used a
biophysical model of neuronal processing, which is optimising the same
thing as the subject. In other words, current DCMs are biophysically
but not functionally informed. The dénouement of this modelling
initiative may be the use of neuronally plausible optimisation schemes
(that perceive, learn and decide) as biophysical DCMs that are trying
to explain observed data. The exciting prospect here is that one can
then disambiguate between neuronal implementations of the functional
models considered above; both in terms of the physical architectures
and time constants of these schemes.There are several nice examples of
mapping from biophysical models to function, which could be addressed
with neuroimaging: There is already a considerable literature
suggesting the decay of short term memory can be explained by
transient population attractor dynamics (e.g., Wong and Wang, 2005)
and decision making with the ‘resolution’ of stochastic instability
(e.g., Deco and Rolls, 2006). The construct validity of these
associations (between emergent properties of dynamical systems and
neuronal computation) may rest on empirical evidence for the implicit
neuronal dynamics during computations that are verified behaviourally;
or indeed the loss of computational capacity in the absence of
requisite dynamics. Again, the message here is that computational
models provide not only a hypothesis about how the brain works but
predictions about both neuronal and behavioural responses that can be
tested jointly in a neuroimaging context.The second challenge is to
model pattern formation (Jirsa and Kelso, 2000; van Albada et al.,
2009; Buice and Cowan, 2009) and autonomous dynamics (Freeman, 1994;
Tsuda, 2001; Breakspear and Stam, 2005; Bressler and Tognoli, 2006;
Rabinovich et al., 2008) using generative models that have the same
degree of biological realism as DCMs for experimentally elicited
responses. This may require extension of the current models to include
spatial fields (e.g., over the cortical surface) that contain these
patterns (e.g., Coombes and Doole, 1996; Jirsa and Kelso, 2000). Some
provisional work has been done in this direction (Daunizeau et al.,
2009), but there are interesting challenges ahead. For example, we may
have to generalise our notion of a connection to a coupling tensor (a
four-dimensional object) that couples two (two-dimensional) fields.
Implicit in this sort of modelling will be the ability to infer the
unknown and instantaneous neuronal states that show self-organised
behaviour. This will require a more thorough development of stochastic
state-space models (stochastic DCMs) that allow for unknown
fluctuations in neuronal activity, which may predominate in the
absence of any exogenous (experimental) input. This may be
particularly important to understand endogenous fluctuations and self-
organised criticality (Buice and Cowan, 2009; Kitzbichler et al.,
2009). It is obvious that these challenges can only be met by
appealing to computational neuroscience and dynamical systems theory,
while exploiting the empirical constraints afforded by imaging
neuroscience.We close this review with an example of how computational
fMRI might be used to disambiguate between competing functional models
and resolve an outstanding question in computational neuroscience (see
Fiorillo et al., 2003; Niv et al., 2005).Classical reinforcement
learning models are based on the solution to something called the
Bellman equation (Bellman, 1952). The solution to this equation can be
very difficult to obtain but can be approximated using iterative
schemes (Sutton and Barto, 1981). These approximate solutions, which
rest on Rescorla and Wagner, 1972). However, a recent computational
perspective suggests that reinforcement learning can be cast in terms
of perceptual learning (Friston et al., 2009). This involves the
suppression of Fiorillo et al., 2003). Crucially, the precision of
prediction error is unsigned, unlike the Niv and Schoenbaum, 2008).
The key question is; does dopamine encode signed prediction error or
unsigned precision or both? Questions about the role of dopamine in
representing precision or uncertainty have been debated earnestly in
the literature (Niv et al., 2005; Fiorillo et al., 2005) and are
exactly the sort of question that computational fMRI could, in
principle, address (by comparing models based on signed prediction
error, unsigned precision, or both). There are other pressing
questions about the role of dopamine in reporting novelty or surprise,
in relation to reward prediction errors (reviewed nicely in Dayan and
Niv, 2008). As noted by Niv and Schoenbaum (2008), “The recognition
that computational ideas from reinforcement learning are relevant to
the study of neural circuits has taken the cognitive neuroscience
community by storm…. Yet, like any revolution, the fast-paced progress
has left an uneven understanding in its wake.” This revolution and its
resolution may rest on computational neuroimaging.
